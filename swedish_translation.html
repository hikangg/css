<p>Being an Indo-European language,  Swedish is one of the several Germanic languages that belong to the North  Germanic branch. It is classified as an East Scandinavian language along with  Danish.  The North Germanic language is  further subdivided into the Insular and Continental Scandinavian languages.</p>
<p>Swedish falls into the Continental Scandinavian bracket along with Danish and Norwegian.  In fact, these three languages are deemed as dialects of a common language due  to their intelligibility. 
  Swedish is not that widely spoken.  With about 10 million speakers most of who live in Sweden and Finland. It is a  descendant of Old Norse which is simply the common language that was used during  the Scandinavian Viking era.</p>
<h2><a href="swedish_translation.html" target="_self">Modern Day Swedish  </a></h2>
<p>Modern day Swedish, also referred to  as Standard Swedish, is the national language of Sweden. However, some dialects  that differ greatly from Standard Swedish still exist. Though the spoken and the  written word are uniform, the varying dialects have different grammar and  vocabulary in some cases. However, these dialects are only used in rural areas  and are spoken by very few people who rarely interact with the urbanites. In  fact, these dialects, though not extinct, have been on the decline over the  years. These<a href="swedish_interpreter.html"> Swedish</a> dialects include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Finland Swedish</li>
          <li>Gotland Swedish</li>
          <li>North Swedish</li>
          <li>Götaland Swedish</li>
          <li>South Swedish</li>
          <li>Svealand Swedish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a href="swedish_translation.html" title="Swedish Grammar" target="_self">Swedish Grammar</a></h2>
        <p>As a rule, the word order for the  Swedish language takes the form of subject- verb- object. Nevertheless this  rule is not static and the order may change when certain words are being  stressed upon. Its morphology is quite similar to that of the English language  as there are very few inflections in the words. </p>
          
         <p> As with most languages, there  is a reference to two genders and grammatical cases. There also  words in the singular and plural forms that  exist. Swedish has quite a large number of vowels; 9 in total. </p>
  
         <h2><a href="swedish_translation.html" target="_self">Swedish Writing System</a>
         </h2>
         <p>Apart from the basic Latin alphabet of  26 letters, Swedish has an extra 3 letters to bring the total to 29. The letter W is however not used  much except in proper names. The extras are Ö/ö, Å/å, and&nbsp;Ä/ä.  These letters were derived from the original runic alphabet that was in use in  the middle ages.  </p>
        <h2><a href="swedish_transcription.html">Swedish  Transcription</a></h2>
        <p>While  it may seem easy for the casual observer, mapping the Swedish spoken language  is not an easy task even for a native speaker. It requires a bit of technical  ability in the field as well as experience. It must pay attention to the  intended audience so as to avoid taking things out of context. The  transcription service provider must not only regurgitate information as it  comes from the speaker but must also capture the spirit of the message.</p>
        <p>In addition to Swedish transcription, we provide Swedish translation to all languages even Swedish to Creole translation. Considering   that Swedish is not that widely spoken, getting a Swedish transcriber can be an  uphill task. Below are some of the factors you should take into consideration  before picking one:          </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Experience:
          First  and foremost you need to determine whether the specialist has any prior  experience in the industry and in particular transcribing Swedish. Most times,  the quality of the output is determined by the experience of the transcriber as  they have faced the most common challenges. </li>
          <li>Accuracy:
            How  accurate are the transcribers? Though you may not know this from the outset,  you should probably agree on a sample job first. Accuracy is crucial as a  slight misrepresentation can change the whole meaning of a document.            </li>
          <li>Cultural  Awareness: 
            
            The  transcriber should be well versed in the culture and have the wisdom to  understand what the speaker meant as opposed to what he said. This can be a  huge stumbling block during transcription as a speaker might say something in  jest which the transcriber might take literally.            </li>
        </ol>
