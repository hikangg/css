<p> You are literally the only resource left to our company in an attempt to resolve a benign clerical error. 
</p>
<p>Our company was removed from <a href="https://www.wellcare.com/Florida" title="We are passionate about serving our members and the communities in which they live. Please watch the following video to see us in action." target="_self">WellCare</a>'s translation vendors list because of a $50 gift card.  How did that happen? </p>
<p>In the spirit of Christmas Holidays, and to genuinely thank our clients for the opportunity to serve them, we send either chocolates or gift cards to each point of contact. 
  </p>
<p>A clerical error from an online order had one extra zero to all the gift cards. 
  </p>
<p>While several recipients, who are still among our current translation clients, jovially questioned the amount of the gift card, our point of contact in WellCare, Ms. Luisa Lara, seemed to have taken this mistake the wrong way. 
  </p>
<h2><a href="kenneth-burdick-wellcare-ceo-tampa-florida.html" title="Wrongful Termination of a Vendor" target="_self">Wrongful Termination from WellCare</a></h2>
<p>Next thing we know was an email notifying us in 2010 that WellCare will stop its 4 year collaboration with Alpha Translation Svcs, Inc. What was the justification? WellCare wanted to "streamline the translation process" and selected one national vendor and another one located in the United Kingdom to do so.</p>
<p> Of course, we were saddened by the decision; however, we respected WellCare's prerogative to do business with whomever they want. We had not even questioned the painful termination of our company until 2012 when WellCare suddenly contacted us again.  WellCare was willing to resume the collaboration! 
  It appears that the &quot;streamline of the process&quot; was not going very well. We noted however that the point of contact was no longer Ms. Luisa Lara. The new point of contact, familiar with our performance, especially during the last two years of service, advocated having our company back as a <a href="kenneth-burdick-wellcare-ceo-tampa-florida.html" title="WellCare Vendor" target="_self">WellCare translation vendor</a>. </p>
<p>Such an attempt failed!
  In the meantime, our translation company has received requests from a national print and translation company to perform translations belonging to WellCare as a subcontractor.  In September 30th, 2015, we notified Ms. Kimberly Lee and Ms. Luisa Lara for a second time that our company was being used to do partial WellCare's translations as a subcontractor. 
  So, it became painfully obvious that we were not terminated due to our performance or cost issues. We can only conclude that Ms. Luisa Lara pointed a clerical error in a gift certificate to that ultimately led to the removal our company as a vendor.</p>
<p> Incidentally, we were shocked to read an email from Ms. Lara to her supervisor saying that "our company is making a lot of money" while she was unaware of our overheads. She has no idea of the amount of resources that it took to deliver the translation of hundreds of <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/health-care-law-protections/summary-of-benefits-and-coverage/" title="Summary of Benefits" target="_self">Summary of Benefits</a> within short period of times.  </p>
<p>Dear Mr. <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2014/12/15/kenneth-burdick-is-wellcare-s-new-ceo-and-1.html" title="Kenneth Burdick is WellCare's new CEO" target="_self">Kenneth Burdick</a>, we know how very difficult it is for us to contact you directly, but are hoping that, when this <a href="kenneth-burdick-wellcare-ceo-tampa-florida.html" title="Open letter to Mr. Kenneth A. Burdick" target="_top">open letter</a> reaches you through the magic of search engine crawling,<a href="https://www.wellcare.com/en/Providers" target="_new"> WellCare</a> will reevaluate our company performance not in the light of a clerical error in a gift card. 
  We have several indications that our company was singled out. When we translated hundreds of books with zero translation errors like in 2009, we got a B because the shade of a picture was slightly different from the original English picture. We also get a B even when we went the extra mile to notify WellCare of several errors that our company found in the English source versions that needed translations! </p>
<p>Why were we contacted again in 2012? Why did a current WellCare vendor contact us to provide <a href="https://alphatranslationservices.com/translation.html" target="_self">translation services</a> in 2015 although our company was removed from <a href="kenneth-burdick-wellcare-ceo-tampa-florida.html">WellCare's vendors list</a>?  Why do the clients' points of contact, who receive the same type of gift certificate, still use our company as a vendor? These are questions that are causing emotional duress.
  We know that this is a trivial matter to an extremely busy <a href="kenneth-burdick-wellcare-ceo-tampa-florida.html">CEO</a>, but we are hoping that these questions will be answered by someone in the appropriate capacity in WellCare.  </p>
<p>Thank you,  </p>
